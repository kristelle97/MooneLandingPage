The menstrual phase marks the start of your cycle ‚Äî days 1 through 5, when bleeding begins. During this time, estrogen and progesterone are at their lowest, which can lead to fatigue, cramps, headaches, and low mood. Your body is also losing iron through menstrual blood, increasing the need for iron-rich and anti-inflammatory foods.

The goal of menstrual phase nutrition is to **replenish nutrients**, **soothe discomfort**, and **support gentle digestion**.
