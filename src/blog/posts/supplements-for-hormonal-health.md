# Supplements That Support Hormonal Health in Women

Food should always come first—but when your hormones feel off, the right **supplements can offer a powerful layer of support**. Whether you’re dealing with PMS, irregular periods, mood swings, or fatigue, specific vitamins, minerals, and herbs can help bring your system back into balance.

Let’s break down the most effective supplements for hormone health, how they work, and when to consider using them.

## ⚖️ How Supplements Help Balance Hormones

Hormonal health depends on multiple body systems working together—your brain (HPO axis), ovaries, adrenals, thyroid, liver, and gut. When any of these are under stress or undernourished, it can lead to imbalances in:

- Estrogen  
- Progesterone  
- Cortisol  
- Testosterone  
- Thyroid hormones  

Targeted supplementation can help:

- Boost nutrient deficiencies that affect hormone production  
- Support detoxification of excess hormones  
- Regulate cycle and ovulation  
- Reduce inflammation and stress on the endocrine system
