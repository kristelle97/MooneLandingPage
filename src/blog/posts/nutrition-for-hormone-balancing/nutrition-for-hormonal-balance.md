## üß¨ Why Hormones Matter (and What Throws Them Off)

Hormones are chemical messengers that control major functions in the body‚Äîreproduction, mood, metabolism, sleep, and more. When hormones like **estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, and insulin** fall out of balance, symptoms follow:

- PMS or heavy periods  
- Mood swings or anxiety  
- Irregular cycles  
- Fatigue or burnout  
- Weight fluctuations  
- Skin breakouts  

Nutrition affects hormone production, metabolism, detoxification, and communication. That‚Äôs why eating the right foods‚Äîat the right time‚Äîcan bring powerful change.

## ü•¶ Key Nutrition Principles for Hormonal Balance

### 1. **Balance Blood Sugar**
Blood sugar rollercoasters trigger excess cortisol and insulin, which throw off estrogen and progesterone.

**Eat:**  
- Protein, fat, and fiber with every meal  
- Complex carbs (quinoa, oats, sweet potato)  
- Minimize added sugars and ultra-processed snacks

---

### 2. **Support Estrogen & Progesterone**
These two key hormones need different nutrients and support at different times in your cycle.

**Estrogen-supportive foods:**  
- Flax, pumpkin seeds, soy, chickpeas, berries

**Estrogen-clearing foods:**  
- Cruciferous vegetables, fiber, fermented foods

**Progesterone-supportive foods:**  
- Vitamin B6-rich foods (chickpeas, salmon)  
- Magnesium (leafy greens, seeds)  
- Zinc (pumpkin seeds, lentils)

---

### 3. **Nourish Your Gut & Liver**
Both help process and eliminate hormones. A sluggish gut or overloaded liver can lead to estrogen dominance or sluggish detox.

**Eat more of:**  
- Leafy greens, beets, garlic, fermented foods  
- Filtered water and lemon water  
- Avoid alcohol and processed oils
