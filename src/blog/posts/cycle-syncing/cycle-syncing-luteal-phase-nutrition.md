The luteal phase is the second half of your menstrual cycle, typically lasting from days 15 to 28. After ovulation, progesterone rises to prepare the body for a potential pregnancy. During this time, many women experience premenstrual symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, cravings, bloating, and breast tenderness.

By making strategic dietary choices, you can reduce these symptoms and support your body through this hormonally intense phase.

## What Happens in the Luteal Phase?

- **Progesterone spikes**, often leading to slower digestion, bloating, and mood fluctuations.  
- **Estrogen drops**, which can trigger cravings, especially for carbs and sweets.  
- **Basal body temperature rises**, increasing your caloric needs slightly (~100‚Äì300 calories/day).

This phase is all about **comfort, nourishment, and stabilization**.
