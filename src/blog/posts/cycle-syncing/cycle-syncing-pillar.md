## Introduction: What Is Cycle Syncing?

Cycle syncing is a wellness approach that involves aligning your nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle habits with the four phases of your menstrual cycle: menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal. This concept was popularized by Alisa Vitti and is rooted in the understanding that women's hormonal fluctuations throughout the month impact everything from metabolism and mood to energy levels and appetite.

The goal of a cycle syncing diet is to support these natural hormonal shifts with targeted nutritional strategies — helping to reduce PMS, support hormonal balance, and optimize physical and mental performance.

## Why Cycle Syncing Works

Hormones like estrogen, progesterone, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) fluctuate predictably during each cycle. By supporting your body's unique needs in each phase, you can:

- Reduce PMS, bloating, and mood swings
- Improve energy, focus, and sleep
- Balance blood sugar and reduce cravings
- Promote fertility and hormonal health

Unlike one-size-fits-all diets, the cycle syncing diet is **personalized and adaptive**, designed to work *with* your body instead of against it.
