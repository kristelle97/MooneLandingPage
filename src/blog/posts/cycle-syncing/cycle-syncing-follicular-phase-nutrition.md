The follicular phase begins right after your period and continues until ovulation (typically days 6‚Äì14). Estrogen and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) start to rise, giving you more energy, focus, and motivation.

This is the time to take advantage of your natural hormonal boost with light, vibrant, and nutrient-rich meals that support mental clarity, metabolism, and gut health.
