## What Causes Hormonal Acne?

### ⚖️ 1. Estrogen-Progesterone Imbalance

- **Low estrogen + high androgens** → increased oil (sebum) production → clogged pores  
- **Low progesterone** → inflammation and slowed skin healing  

---

### 🍬 2. Blood Sugar Dysregulation

- Blood sugar spikes → **high insulin** → triggers excess **androgen** production → more oil + acne  

---

### 😰 3. Chronic Stress & Elevated Cortisol

- Chronic stress → **cortisol imbalances** → worsens inflammation and disrupts hormone rhythms  
- Also contributes to **gut issues** → increased acne risk  

---

### 💊 4. Coming Off Birth Control

- Hormones fluctuate after stopping the pill → skin may purge as **natural hormone cycles re-establish**  

---

### 💥 5. Gut & Liver Imbalances

- Poor gut health impairs **estrogen clearance** → estrogen dominance  
- Liver overload prevents detox of hormone metabolites → skin breakouts
