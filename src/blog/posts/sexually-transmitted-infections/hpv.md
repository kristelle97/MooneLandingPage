## Description
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. There are more than 100 types of HPV, some of which can cause genital warts and others that can lead to cancers, including cervical, anal, and throat cancers. HPV is transmitted through vaginal, anal, or oral sex with an infected person. Most sexually active people will get HPV at some point in their lives, often without knowing it.

Most HPV infections go away on their own and do not cause health problems. However, some types of HPV can persist and cause serious complications. Vaccination, regular screening, and safe sex practices are key to preventing HPV-related health issues.

## Symptoms
Most people with HPV do not develop symptoms or health problems. When symptoms do occur, they may include:

- Genital warts: Small bumps or groups of bumps in the genital area, which can be raised, flat, or cauliflower-shaped
- Warts on the throat (rare)
- Precancerous changes in the cervix, vulva, vagina, penis, anus, or throat (detected through screening)

HPV-related cancers often do not cause symptoms until they are advanced, which is why regular screening is important.

## How to Know if You Have It
There is no routine test for HPV in men, but women can be screened for HPV as part of cervical cancer screening (Pap test and HPV test). Diagnosis may involve:
- Visual inspection of warts
- Pap test (for cervical cell changes)
- HPV DNA test (for high-risk HPV types)

Screening is recommended for:
- Women aged 21-65 (Pap test every 3 years, or Pap + HPV test every 5 years)
- People with symptoms or visible warts
- Men who have sex with men (anal Pap test in some cases)

If you have symptoms or a partner diagnosed with HPV, see a healthcare provider for evaluation.

## Treatment
There is no cure for the virus itself, but treatments are available for health problems caused by HPV:
- Genital warts can be treated with prescription medications, cryotherapy (freezing), surgical removal, or laser therapy
- Precancerous changes can be managed with procedures to remove abnormal tissue
- Cancers caused by HPV require specialized treatment (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy)

The HPV vaccine is highly effective at preventing infection with the most dangerous types of HPV. Vaccination is recommended for:
- All preteens (boys and girls) at age 11 or 12
- Everyone up to age 26 if not previously vaccinated
- Some adults aged 27-45 after discussion with a healthcare provider

## Conclusion
HPV is extremely common and often harmless, but certain types can cause serious health problems. Vaccination, regular screening, and safe sex are the best ways to protect yourself and your partners. Talk to your healthcare provider about HPV vaccination and screening options. Early detection and prevention are key to reducing the impact of HPV.
