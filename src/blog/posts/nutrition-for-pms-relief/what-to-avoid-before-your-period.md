# What to Avoid Before Your Period

The days before your period are when PMS symptoms like bloating, cramps, irritability, and fatigue tend to peak. While adding nutrient-dense foods can help, **knowing what to avoid** is just as important.

Below are the top foods and habits to limit in the **luteal phase** to help you feel more balanced and in control.

---

## 1. **Refined Sugar**

**Why to avoid it:** Sugar causes spikes and crashes in blood sugar, worsening mood swings, fatigue, and cravings. It also increases inflammation, which can intensify cramps and bloating.

> 🔁 Swap with: Fresh fruit, dark chocolate, or cinnamon for natural sweetness.

---

## 2. **Caffeine**

**Why to avoid it:** Caffeine can increase anxiety, irritability, and breast tenderness during PMS. It may also interfere with sleep—something your body especially needs in the days before your period.

> 🔁 Try: Herbal teas like chamomile, peppermint, or ginger.

---

## 3. **Alcohol**

**Why to avoid it:** Alcohol can disrupt estrogen and progesterone levels, impact liver detoxification, and worsen mood swings. It also interferes with sleep and hydration—two key factors for PMS relief.

> 🔁 Consider: Sparkling water with lime or a mocktail with adaptogens.

---

## 4. **Ultra-Processed Foods**

**Why to avoid them:** Processed foods are often high in sodium, refined carbs, and preservatives that can trigger water retention and bloating. They also lack the nutrients your body needs for hormone balance.

> 🔁 Focus on: Whole foods with fiber, protein, and healthy fats.

---

## 5. **Trans Fats**

**Why to avoid them:** Found in some packaged snacks, fried foods, and margarine, trans fats are highly inflammatory and have been linked to increased PMS symptoms and hormonal disruption.

> ✅ Check labels: Look for "partially hydrogenated oils" and avoid them completely.

---

## 6. **Skipping Meals**

**Why to avoid it:** Blood sugar crashes caused by skipped meals can intensify PMS-related fatigue, cravings, and irritability. Your metabolism may even increase slightly before your period, so consistent fuel is key.

> 🔁 Stick to: Balanced meals every 3–4 hours, and prep ahead when possible.

---

## Lifestyle Triggers to Watch

- **Lack of sleep**: Poor sleep worsens PMS mood and energy issues. Aim for 7–9 hours.
- **High stress**: Elevated cortisol levels affect estrogen/progesterone ratios. Practice deep breathing or yoga.
- **Overexercising**: Intense exercise can spike cortisol. Try restorative movement like walking or Pilates pre-period.

---

## Takeaway

What you **don’t** eat or do before your period can be just as impactful as what you do. Avoiding these key triggers can help reduce bloating, stabilize your mood, and support hormone balance.

> 📆 Start tracking how these changes affect your cycle—you’ll likely notice real improvements within 1–2 cycles.
