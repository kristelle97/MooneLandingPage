## 1. What Is Menstrual Blood?

Menstrual blood is a mixture of blood, vaginal secretions, and the shed lining of the uterus (endometrium). It's released through the vagina during the menstrual phase of the cycle, typically lasting 3–7 days.

## 2. Composition of Menstrual Blood

- **Blood:** About 35–50% of menstrual fluid is actual blood.
- **Endometrial tissue:** The main component, made up of cells from the uterine lining.
- **Cervical and vaginal mucus:** Helps the flow move smoothly.
- **Other cells:** Including immune cells and bacteria from the vaginal microbiome.

## 3. What the Color Means

- **Bright red:** Fresh blood, common at the start of your period.
- **Dark red or brown:** Older blood, often seen at the end of your period or after lying down.
- **Pink:** Diluted blood, may occur with light flow or spotting.
- **Gray:** Possible sign of infection—see a doctor if you notice this.

## 4. Volume and Flow: What's Normal?

- **Average blood loss:** 30–50 mL (2–3 tablespoons) per cycle.
- **Heavy flow:** More than 80 mL per cycle, soaking through pads/tampons every hour.
- **Light flow:** Less than 20 mL per cycle, may be normal for some but can indicate hormonal issues if persistent.

## 5. Clots, Odor, and Other Variations

- **Small clots:** (smaller than a quarter) are normal, especially on heavy days.
- **Large clots:** May indicate heavy bleeding or fibroids—see a doctor if frequent.
- **Mild odor:** Normal, but strong or foul odor can signal infection.

## 6. What Changes Can Indicate

- **Sudden heavy bleeding:** Could be fibroids, polyps, or hormonal imbalance.
- **Very light or missed periods:** May signal stress, low body weight, thyroid issues, or PCOS.
- **Irregular color (gray, green):** Possible infection or retained tissue—seek medical advice.

## 7. When to Seek Medical Advice

Contact a healthcare provider if you notice:
- Bleeding lasting more than 7 days
- Passing large clots frequently
- Very heavy flow (soaking through protection every hour)
- Foul-smelling discharge
- Severe pain or fever

## 8. Conclusion

Your period is a vital sign. Paying attention to changes in your menstrual blood can help you catch health issues early and advocate for your well-being. If you notice anything unusual, don't hesitate to reach out to a healthcare professional.
