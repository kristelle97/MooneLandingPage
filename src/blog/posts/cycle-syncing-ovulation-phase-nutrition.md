Ovulation marks the midpoint of your menstrual cycle and is the peak of estrogen production. It's also when you're most fertile. Your body is primed for energy, strength, and connection — and your nutritional needs reflect that. A diet rich in antioxidants, fiber, and healthy fats can help support hormonal balance, egg health, and liver function during this phase.
