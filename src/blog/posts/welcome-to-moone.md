At Moone, we believe that nutrition should work *with* your body — not against it. That’s why we built the first nutrition app made specifically for women, designed to support your health in sync with your hormonal cycle. Whether you're dealing with PMS, perimenopause, or just looking to feel better in your body, Moone is your science-backed partner in personalized nutrition.

## 🌿 What We Do


Moone is not a calorie-counting app — and that’s intentional. We believe women deserve better than one-size-fits-all diet rules. Instead, Moone offers dynamic, personalized nutrition support that evolves with your cycle and lifestyle.

Here’s how we help:

- **1-Click AI Food Logging**  
  No more tedious tracking. Moone makes logging simple — just snap, type, or speak your meals into the app.

- **Cycle-Aware Nutrition Guidance**  
  Your needs shift throughout your hormonal cycle. Moone adapts your nutrition recommendations accordingly — with personalized macronutrient and micronutrient guidance to support energy, cravings, digestion, and more.

- **Habit & Symptom Tracking**  
  Track how your habits, mood, energy, and cycle phases interact. Moone connects the dots so you can better understand your body.

- **Science-Backed, Calorie-Free Insights**  
  Get evidence-based recommendations tailored to your goals — without calorie counts or restrictive advice.

## ✨ Our Values

At Moone, we’re not here to tell you to eat less or restrict more. We’re here to help you feel better, stronger, and more in control — on your terms.

- **Personalization Over Perfection**  
  No two bodies are the same. Moone adapts to *you* — not the other way around.

- **Evidence-First**  
  Our recommendations are rooted in the latest research in women’s health, nutrition science, and hormonal biology.

- **Empowerment Through Education**  
  When you understand your body, you can work with it — not fight against it.

- **Progress, Not Pressure**  
  Health isn’t a one-size-fits-all sprint. It’s a journey. We’re with you every step of the way.
