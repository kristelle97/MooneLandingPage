## Introduction

Menopause is a natural biological process that marks the end of a woman’s reproductive years, typically occurring in their late 40s to early 50s. This transition is often accompanied by a variety of symptoms such as hot flashes, mood swings, sleep disturbances, and more. While hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a common medical treatment, many women seek natural alternatives to manage these symptoms due to concerns about side effects or personal preferences.

This article delves into evidence-based natural strategies that can help manage menopausal symptoms. By understanding and adopting these approaches, women can potentially reduce the severity of their symptoms and improve their overall quality of life during this transition.
