## 🌿 Why Nutrition Matters for PMS

PMS symptoms often intensify in the **luteal phase**—the 1–2 weeks before your period—when estrogen drops, progesterone rises, and your serotonin levels fluctuate. Diet plays a major role in how your body manages these shifts.

> 🧬 The right foods can support hormone metabolism, gut health, and mood-regulating neurotransmitters like serotonin.

## 🍽️ Core Strategies for PMS-Relief Nutrition

### 1. **Eat More Anti-Inflammatory Foods**

Chronic inflammation can worsen cramps, mood swings, and fatigue. A diet rich in leafy greens, omega-3s, whole grains, and colorful fruits can reduce inflammatory markers.
