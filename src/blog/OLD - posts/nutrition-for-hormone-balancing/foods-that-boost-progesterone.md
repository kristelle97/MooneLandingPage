## üß† Why Progesterone Matters

Progesterone is produced mainly after ovulation during the luteal phase. Low levels may lead to:

- Irregular cycles or missed periods  
- Mood swings and anxiety  
- Difficulty conceiving  
- Spotting before your period  
- Estrogen dominance symptoms (bloating, tender breasts, PMS)

Supporting healthy progesterone levels through nutrition can help restore balance and reduce these symptoms.
