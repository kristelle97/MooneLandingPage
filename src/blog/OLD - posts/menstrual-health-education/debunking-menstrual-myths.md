## 1. Myth: Periods Are Dirty or Impure

**Fact:** Menstruation is a natural, healthy process. There's nothing dirty or impure about it. This myth is rooted in cultural taboos, not science.

## 2. Myth: You Can't Get Pregnant During Your Period

**Fact:** While it's less likely, it's still possible to get pregnant if you have sex during your period, especially if you have a short cycle or irregular ovulation.

## 3. Myth: Exercise Should Be Avoided on Your Period

**Fact:** Exercise can actually help relieve cramps, boost mood, and improve energy. Listen to your body, but movement is generally beneficial during your period.

## 4. Myth: Irregular Cycles Are Always a Problem

**Fact:** Occasional irregularity is common, especially in teens, postpartum, or perimenopause. Persistent irregularity may warrant a checkup, but not all variation is a sign of illness.

## 5. Myth: Tampons Cause Toxic Shock Syndrome in Everyone

**Fact:** Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is rare. Using tampons safely (changing every 4–8 hours, using the lowest absorbency needed) minimizes risk.

## 6. Myth: Menstrual Blood Is Different from Regular Blood

**Fact:** Menstrual blood is mostly regular blood mixed with uterine lining and mucus. It's not "dirty" or fundamentally different from other blood in your body.

## 7. Myth: PMS Is "All in Your Head"

**Fact:** PMS is real and linked to hormonal changes. Symptoms can be physical, emotional, or both, and are recognized by medical professionals.

## 8. How to Spot Misinformation

- Check sources: Look for information from reputable health organizations or peer-reviewed studies.
- Be wary of sensational claims or products promising miracle cures.
- Talk to a healthcare provider if you're unsure.

## 9. Conclusion

Knowledge is power. By debunking menstrual myths, we can reduce stigma and empower everyone to make informed choices about their health. If you have questions or concerns, seek out science-backed resources or consult a healthcare professional.
